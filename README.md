# spring-mvc-demo
Hello,
This is a repo for for files generated from a video training course called Spring & Hibernate for Beginners (includes Spring Boot).
I am discovering I have used Spring when updating and creating Java apps but I did not know some of the pieces were from the Spring framework. I thought it was all Java.
Now I know better.
